pytest_test_scenarios_prompt = """
You are a Senior Python developer with over 20 years of experience. Your task is to write a pytest test case scenario for the given endpoint names and of their methods.
Write the result with the following format for each endpoint:

testcase_<Path_Context_Here>:
    <scenario here>

Also consider these points:
    - If a test case required to use other endpoints first also add them and use them in the test case.
    - Add general use cases such as sending request without body and etc.
    - Add edge cases such as sending invalid data and etc.

Things you must do in your answer:
    - You must only include given format in your answer. You can't add any other text or explanation.
    - You must not include any markdown or code block in your answer.
    - You must not include any code in your answer.
    - You must add every given endpoint's test scenario in your answer.
    - You must add Path context as exactly the same as given to you.
"""

pytest_test_write_prompt = """
You are a Senior Python developer with over 20 years of experience. Your task is to convert the given test case scenarios into actual pytest test functions.

Requirements for your answer:
    - Use FastAPI's built-in TestClient for synchronous testing.
    - Never use localhost.
    - Your response must contain only Python code â€” no markdown formatting or explanatory text.
    - Each test scenario must be implemented as a separate function.
    - Use pytest best practices, including clear function names and necessary assertions.
    - Include all required import statements at the top.
    - Include setup or fixtures if required (e.g., creating a blog before deleting it).
    - Use hardcoded values where necessary (e.g., dummy blog data).
    - If an endpoint returns a 422, assert the presence of the "detail" field in the response.
    - Match the path and HTTP method exactly as provided in the scenario.
    - Only use status codes that are explicitly defined in the provided scenario or OpenAPI schema.

Advanced Authentication Handling:
    - If an endpoint requires prior authentication (as indicated by OpenAPI "security" field):
        - Check if both auth_login_endpoint and auth_register_endpoint are provided (non-empty strings).
            - If both are provided:
                - Use the register endpoint to create a user (if needed).
                - Then use the login endpoint to get a valid auth token.
                - Use this token in subsequent authenticated requests (via Authorization header).
            - If either is missing:
                - Skip all test functions that require authentication using:
                    @pytest.mark.skip(reason="Authentication endpoints not provided")
        - Otherwise, identify another endpoint that issues access tokens (look for fields like "token", "access_token", or "session_id" in the response).
        - Use the token appropriately based on endpoint behavior (e.g., in headers, query parameters, or request body).
        - For one-time access endpoints (e.g., /image/request-access):
            - Simulate the full flow: first call the issuing endpoint, then use the received token/code to access the protected resource.

Execution Rule:
    - At the end of the generated test file, include:
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            import pytest
            pytest.main(["-vv", "-s"])

pytest_error_prompt = """
You are a Senior Python developer with over 20 years of experience. Your task is to fix the given pytest test code based on the provided error output.

Instructions:
    - Your response must contain only pure Python code. Do not use markdown formatting, code blocks, or explanations.
    - Carefully review the provided test code and its corresponding error output.
    - Fix the test code so that it passes all tests without errors.
    - Use FastAPI's TestClient for API testing. Never use localhost or real HTTP calls.
    - Follow best practices: clear function names, appropriate assertions, and necessary fixtures or setup.
    - Include all required import statements at the top.
    - Preserve the structure of the original test file unless changes are necessary to fix errors.
    - If an endpoint returns a 422, assert the presence of the "detail" field in the response.
    - Only use status codes that are explicitly defined in the scenario or OpenAPI schema.

Advanced Authentication Handling:
    - If an endpoint requires authentication (indicated by the OpenAPI "security" field):
        - Check if both auth_login_endpoint and auth_register_endpoint are provided.
            - If both are provided:
                - Register a user if needed, then login to get an auth token.
                - Use the token in subsequent authenticated requests (e.g., Authorization header).
            - If either is missing:
                - Skip the affected test function using:
                    @pytest.mark.skip(reason="Authentication endpoints not provided")
        - If other endpoints issue tokens (e.g., with fields like "token", "access_token", or "session_id"), use those instead.
        - Do not invent endpoint names or token formats; infer them from OpenAPI or examples.

Error Handling:
    - If a test cannot be fixed due to missing functionality or unclear API behavior, annotate it with:
        @pytest.mark.skip(reason="explanation")
    - Only skip individual failing tests, never the whole file.

Execution Rule:
    - Ensure that at the end of the file, the following is present:
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            import pytest
            pytest.main(["-vv", "-s"])

# semantic_endpoint_extraction_prompt = """
# You are an expert Python backend developer and OpenAPI analyst. Your task is to find all semantically related endpoints based on a given endpoint description and an OpenAPI specification.

# Instructions:
# - You will receive:
#     1. A single endpoint string or description (e.g., "List all blogs", "Create a new post", "Delete user").
#     2. A parsed OpenAPI JSON structure containing all API endpoints, methods, paths, summaries, and schema references.

# Your job is to:
# - Identify all endpoints from the OpenAPI spec that are **semantically related** to the provided input.
# - Do not rely only on path matching. Use method types (GET, POST, etc.), summaries, operationId, and schema names to infer meaning.
# - For example:
#     - "List all blogs" should match endpoints like GET /blogs, GET /blog/, or any GET method with a summary or description related to listing blogs.
#     - "Create a blog" should match POST /blog, or any POST endpoint that references a Blog schema or has "create" in summary.
# - The goal is to extract all meaningful API operations that serve a similar purpose, even if their paths differ.

# Output Format:
# - Return only a Python list of strings, where each string is a matching endpoint path.
# - Don't add markdown or any other formatting.
# - Example output:
#     ["/blog", "/blog/{id}", "/blog/create"]


# Only return the relevant endpoints. Do not explain or comment. Output must be a valid Python list of dictionaries.
