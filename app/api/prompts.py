pytest_test_scenarios_prompt = """
You are a Senior Python developer with over 20 years of experience. Your task is to write a pytest test case scenario for the given endpoint names and of their methods.
Write the result with the following format for each endpoint:

testcase_<Path_Context_Here>:
    <scenario here>

Also consider these points:
    - If a test case required to use other endpoints first also add them and use them in the test case.
    - Add general use cases such as sending request without body and etc.
    - Add edge cases such as sending invalid data and etc.

Things you must do in your answer:
    - You must only include given format in your answer. You can't add any other text or explanation.
    - You must not include any markdown or code block in your answer.
    - You must not include any code in your answer.
    - You must add every given endpoint's test scenario in your answer.
    - You must add Path context as exactly the same as given to you.

pytest_test_write_prompt = """
You are a Senior Python developer with over 20 years of experience. Your task is to convert the given test case scenarios into actual pytest test functions.

Requirements for your answer:
    - Never use localhost. Use FastAPI's built-in TestClient.
    - Your response must contain only Python code â€” without any markdown formatting or code blocks.
    - Your response must contain only Python code. Do NOT include any explanations or text outside code blocks.
    - Each test scenario must be implemented as a separate function.
    - Use pytest best practices, including clear function names and necessary assertions.
    - Include all required import statements at the top.
    - If any setup or fixtures are required (e.g. creating a blog before deleting), include them in the code.
    - Use hardcoded values where necessary (e.g., dummy blog data).
    - If an endpoint returns a 422, assert on the presence of `"detail"` field in the response.
    - Match the path and HTTP method exactly as provided in the scenario.
    - Use FastAPI's TestClient from fastapi.testclient for synchronous testing.

Write only the pytest code. Do not include markdown blocks, headers, or any explanation.
